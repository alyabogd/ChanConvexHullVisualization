# ChanConvexHullVisualization

Chan Convex Hull Algorithm is an optimal algorithm to compute the convex hull of _n_ points. It takes _O(n*logh)_ time to build 
convex hull, where _h_ is the number of points in the output (in the convex hull). Learn more about algorithm 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan%27s_algorithm).

This repository contains python app that demonstrates how _Chan Algorithm_ works. It has a visualisation of all steps the 
algorithm performs to build the convex hull with explanation comments.
